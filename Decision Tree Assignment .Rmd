For this project we will be using data from the Assistants Intelligent Tutoring system. This system gives students hints based on how they perform on math problems. 

#Install & call libraries
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(party)
```

## Part I
```{r}
D1 <- read.csv("intelligent_tutor.csv", stringsAsFactors =TRUE, header=TRUE)

#check the data types
str(D1)
```

##Classification Tree
First we will build a classification tree to predict which students ask a teacher for help, which start a new session, or which give up, based on whether or not the student completed a session (D1$complete) and whether or not they asked for hints (D1$hint.y). 
```{r}

c.tree <- rpart(action ~ hint.y + complete, method="class", data=D1) 

#Look at the error of this tree
printcp(c.tree)

#Plot the tree
post(c.tree, file = "tree.ps", title = "Session Completion Action: 1 - Ask teacher, 2 - Start new session, 3 - Give up")

library(rpart.plot)
rpart.plot(c.tree)
```
The classification model outcome shows that 46% of the students end up asking teachers and while 26% would be starting a new session and another 28% giving up. This classification is based on whether they receive hints and whether they complete the session.

## Part II    

#Regression Tree

We want to see if we can build a decision tree to help teachers decide which students to follow up with, based on students' performance in Assistants. We will create three groups ("teacher should intervene", "teacher should monitor student progress" and "no action") based on students' previous use of the system and how many hints they use. To do this we will be building a decision tree using the "party" package. The party package builds decision trees based on a set of statistical stopping rules.

#Visualize our outcome variable "score"
```{r}
hist(D1$score)
```

#Create a categorical outcome variable based on student score to advise the teacher using an "ifelse" statement
```{r}
#look at the quantile and decide 
quantile(D1$score)
D1$advice <- ifelse(D1$score>0.9,"no action",
                    ifelse(D1$score>0.67,"teacher should monitor student progress","teacher should intervene")
                    )

```

#Build a decision tree that predicts "advice" based on how many problems students have answered before, the percentage of those problems they got correct and how many hints they required( Theese are continuous variables)
```{r}
score_ctree <- rpart(as.factor(advice)~prior_prob_count+prior_percent_correct+hints,method = "class",data=D1)

printcp(score_ctree)
```

#Plot tree
```{r}
rpart.plot(score_ctree)
```

Here we see two major behaviors the teacher should most closely pay attention to.

Answer:  
1. Teacher should pay more attention to whether the students have ask for hints.  
2. And how many question they have asked 

#Test Tree
Upload the data "intelligent_tutor_new.csv". This is a data set of a different sample of students doing the same problems in the same system. We can use the tree we built for the previous dataset to try to predict the "advice" we should give the teacher about these new students. 

```{r}
#Upload new data

D2 <-read.csv("intelligent_tutor_new.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,header =TRUE )

#Generate predicted advice using the predict() command for new students based on tree generated from old students
#D2$score<-NULL
D2$prediction <-predict(score_ctree,D2,"class")

``` 
## Part III
Compare the predicted advice with the actual advice that these students received. What is the difference between the observed and predicted results?

```{r}
D2$advise<-ifelse(D2$score>0.9,"no action",
                    ifelse(D2$score>0.67,"teacher should monitor student progress","teacher should intervene")
                    )

D2$prediction==D2$advise # very different

mean(D2$prediction==D2$advise)

```

Since the model was built based not on score and the actual advise was given according to the score, so the model wasn't very good at predicting the results, only 22.5% accuracy~
